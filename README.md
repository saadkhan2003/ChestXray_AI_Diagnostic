### Prerequisites
- Google account (for Google Colab)
- Trained model files (`pneumonia_model_best.h5` and `covid_model_best.h5`)
- Basic understanding of Jupyter notebooks

### Deployment Steps

1. **Open the Notebook in Google Colab**
   - Upload `notebooks/XRAY_Detection.ipynb` to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
   - Or open directly from GitHub

2. **Enable GPU Runtime**
   ```
   Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí Hardware accelerator: GPU ‚Üí Save
   ```

3. **Mount Google Drive**
   - Run the first cells to mount your Google Drive
   - Upload your trained models to Google Drive
   - Update the `PROJECT_DIR` path in the notebook to point to your models

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - The notebook will automatically install required packages (Gradio, etc.)

5. **Run All Cells**
   - Execute cells sequentially or use `Runtime ‚Üí Run all`
   - Models will be loaded from your specified Google Drive location

6. **Get Your Public URL**
   - Once launched, Gradio generates a shareable public link
   - Share this URL with anyone to access your app
   - Link remains active as long as the Colab session is running

**That's it!** Your AI diagnostic tool is now live! üéâ

- **File Size**: ~80-100 MB

**COVID-19 Detection Model**
- **Input**: 224√ó224√ó3 RGB chest X-ray images
- **Output**: Binary classification (Normal vs COVID-19)
- **Architecture**: DenseNet-121 base + custom classification head
- **File Size**: ~80-100 MB

### Image Preprocessing

```python
1. Convert to RGB (if needed)
2. Resize to 224√ó224 pixels
3. Normalize pixel values (0-1 range)
4. Batch dimension expansion
```
